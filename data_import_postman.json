after import all this collection you can start to insert data to your localhost database (MAMP->phpmySQL)

1. first of all : do "signup" yourself as an user: use SignUp collection
2. add "agentBehavior": this agentBehavior simulate how does cooking device process works
	there're three request in the collection:
	which correspond to oven, ricecooker,ricecooker2. 
	BE SURE TO SEND THEM IN ORDER!!!!
3. In the collection "Agent", add agent to database, agent here is the cooking device in your home ,
 	each device has it own process (which is the id of agentBehavior),
 	send these 5 request  and you can test them with my recipe example
4. In collection "metaworkflowcreat", use this request to add an recipe into the database.
5. In collection "ingredient", use this request to add the ingrdient that the user own in his home.


All the other collection help you to simulate the user side application to communicate with server
but you don't need to use them to set up the database.
